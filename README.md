# turtle_bike


### Here is a code simulating a simply kinematic bike model using turtlesim

### In order to start first you type: roslaunch session turtle.launch

### In the first run the user will have to enter the following in order:

### 1) Speed of the bike

### 2) Steering angle

### 3) Choose between (f) front steering or (r) rear steering

### 4) Finally you specify for how long the simulation will run

### in subsequent runs the user will also have to input the distance from the c.g to the rear and front wheels as in the first run these variables are imported from a .yaml file

### Here is a video of the turtle going with front drive with no decay:
